# LMS Web App Planning — Index

Vision: To create a flexible, user-friendly, and scalable Learning Management System that empowers learners, instructors, and administrators by providing a structured yet adaptable environment for managing programming problems structured around courses, assignments, submissions, and feedback. The LMS will support diverse learning needs, streamline administrative processes, and foster meaningful engagement between all roles in the system. You'll also need to add some kind of cool feature for a unique submission type.

**Unique Submission Type:** **Code + Reflection** — along with a standard code/file upload, the student submitting the assignment writes a brief (2–5 sentences) reflection on their approach or what they learned. This is plain text and stored with the submission for instructors to read. This will show their knowledge with the assignment and that they understand the code that they are writing and the purpose of it.

## Other Unique Feature Ideas
- inline code comments, like Github PR style
- global command menu (cmd +k ) to search anything from anywhere on the LMS
- better task tracking, keep track of HW and Assignments
- streaks for homework submissions, gamify it a bit
- rubric, templates, reusable document library for commonly accessed documents for instructors
