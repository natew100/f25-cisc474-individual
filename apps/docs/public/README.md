# LMS Web App Planning — Deliverables Index (Nathan Wolf)

> **Repo path:** `apps/docs/public/`

This page links to each required piece for the assignment.

- **Requirements document (with user stories):** [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
- **Site map (frontend pages):** [`sitemap.md`](./sitemap.md)
- **Wireframes (major screens):** [`wireframes.md`](./wireframes.md)
- **Basic data model diagram (major nouns):** [`data_model.md`](./data_model.md)

If a file covers more than one requirement, the section headings inside that file make the mapping explicit.

## Unique Submission Type — “Code+Voice”
This LMS includes a unique submission type called **Code+Voice**. Students submit their code **plus a 60–90s audio explanation** captured in‑app. The system stores:
- Code snapshot (files, language, runtime)
- Audio clip (transcribed for accessibility + search)
- Autograder results (tests, runtime logs)
- **Timeline of attempts** (commit-like history of runs) with deltas

This is embedded throughout the deliverables: requirements, site map, wireframes, and the ERD.
